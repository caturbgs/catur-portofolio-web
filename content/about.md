Greetings! I am Catur Bagaskara, a Software Developer based in Depok, West Java, with a deep passion for Website Development. I am constantly seeking new ways to improve my skills and have honed my expertise in website applications.
<br><br>

I spent my whole childhood in Depok, West Java. It was once a calm, slow-paced satellite city, but now it’s a high-energy hub that’ll make you question your life choices (just kidding!).
<br><br>

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by all things computer-related. I still remember the first time I used a PC—I could sit for hours on end, day and night, completely absorbed in games like Pinball and old-school shooters. That didn't change in my teenage years. After getting back from school, I would lock myself in my room and get lost in the worlds of the PlayStation 1 and 2.
<br><br>

I think that was the motivation for me to learn how the computer works. I just love to build an application, to make a logic-heavy challenging REST API or make a beautifully eye-catching designed website. I'm feel like just love to the both worlds. Frontend and Backend.
<br><br>

Besides coding, I love to traveling to a new place, cooking some foodies, and the last but not least, is playing a games! xD
<br><br>
